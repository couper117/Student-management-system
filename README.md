# Student Management System (CRUD using JS Arrays)

##  Project Description
This project is a raw JavaScript implementation of a Student Management System. It demonstrates mastery of core programming concepts including **CRUD operations** (Create, Read, Update, Delete) and advanced data manipulation (Filtering, Sorting, Counting) using only **JavaScript Arrays and Objects**.

The goal was to build the logic of a database system without relying on external libraries like Express.js or MongoDB, focusing purely on algorithmic logic and data structures.

### Key Features
* **Create:** Add students with strict validation (Unique IDs, valid Age/Gender).
* **Read:** Fetch all students or search by specific ID.
* **Update:** Modify student details (Name, Age, Grade) while preserving the unique ID.
* **Delete:** Remove records efficiently.
* **Analysis:**
    * Filter for Male/Female students.
    * Sort students alphabetically by name.
    * Identify the oldest student.
    * Count total students in specific grades.


##  Presentation Video
I have recorded a short video explaining the logic behind the code, specifically how the `map`, `filter`, and `reduce` methods function.
